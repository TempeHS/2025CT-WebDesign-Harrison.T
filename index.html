       <h2 style="color: white;"> Why are doves so special? </h2>

       <strong style="color:white;"> Doves are common birds with a very symbolic history. Many religions and cultures
              celebrate doves as a symbol of peace.
              The Christian religion uses the dove as a symbol of God, while other cultures release doves into the sky
              at ceremonies,
              weddings, and other important events.</strong>

       <h2 style="color: white;"> What are <strong> doves? </strong></h2>

       <emotional style="color: white;"> Columbidae (/kəˈlʌmbɪdiː/ kə-LUM-bih-dee) is a bird family consisting of doves
              and
              pigeons. It is the only family in the
              order Columbiformes. These are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills that in
              some
              species feature
              fleshy ceres. They primarily feed on plants, and can be taxonomically divided amongst granivores,
              that
              feed mostly on
              the ground on seeds, and frugivores, that feed mostly on fruits, from branches. The family occurs
              worldwide, often in
              close proximity with humans, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalayan and Australasian
              realms. </emotional>

       <h2 style="color: white;"> Interesting facts about Columbidae</h2>


       <p style="color: white;"> Young doves are called squabs.
              Unlike other birds, doves don’t tuck their heads in their wings when they sleep.
              Though they breed with different doves during breeding season, doves mate for life with one companion
              bird.
              The pigeon beats its wings up to ten times per second, and can go 16 hours without rest.
              Doves live in every continent except Antarctica.
              Female doves typically lay two eggs at a time.
              Homing pigeons used to carry messages during war, and had an impressive delivery success rate of 95%.
              Rock pigeons are a type of dove that typically nests on cliff edges and window ledges. </p>
